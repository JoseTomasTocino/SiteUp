\begin{document}

We explain in this section how to obtain headings
for the various sections and subsections of our
document.

In the ``article'' style, the document may be divided up
into sections, subsections and subsubsections, and each
can be given a title, printed in a boldface font,
simply by issuing the appropriate command.
